## Problem Description
```
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
The '.' character indicates empty cells.
Example:
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:

```

## Code

- Support Language: Python

```
class Solution:
    def solveSudoku(self, board):
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        def backtrack(board):
            for i in range(len(board)):  #遍历行
                for j in range(len(board[0])):  #遍历列
                    if board[i][j] != ".": continue
                    for k in range(1,10):  #(i, j) 这个位置放k是否合适
                        if isValid(i,j,k,board):
                            board[i][j] = str(k)  #放置k

            return True  #遍历完没有返回false，说明找到了合适棋盘位置了
        def isValid(row,col,val,board):

                if board[row][i] == str(val):

            for j in range(9):  #判断列里是否重复
                if board[j][col] == str(val):
                    return False
            startRow = (row // 3) * 3
            startcol = (col // 3) * 3
            for i in range(startRow,startRow + 3):  #判断9方格里是否重复
                for j in range(startcol,startcol + 3):

            return True
        backtrack(board)
