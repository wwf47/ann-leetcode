## Problem
Two sum
https://leetcode.cn/problems/two-sum

## Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Code

- Support Language: Python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i,j]
        return []
